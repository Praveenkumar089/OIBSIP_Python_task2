BMI Calculator 
What it does:
Asks for your weight (kg) and height (m).
Calculates your BMI (Body Mass Index).
Tells you if you are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
 How it works:
BMI formula = weight ÷ (height × height).Example: If weight = 70 kg and height = 1.75 m → BMI = 22.86.
The program compares your BMI with standard ranges:
Less than 18.5 → Underweight
18.5 to 24.9 → Normal
25 to 29.9 → Overweight
30 and above → Obese
 It’s like a mini health tool to quickly check your BMI.
